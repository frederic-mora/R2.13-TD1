                        <p>
                            I am a web developer and UX designer based in the beautiful west coast of Spain, Galicia.
                            I really enjoy solving problems as well as making things pretty and easy to use. 
                            I can't stop learning new things; the more, the better. I also love photography, 
                            a hobby I'm taking along since the good old film cameras. Oh, and rice with milk; 
                            I have a passion for rice with milk!</p>
                        <p>
                            I'm a programmer.<br>
                            For the front-end I usually work with Javascript, either standalone or including popular frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS. 
                            I also make the web pretty by using Sass, CSS and, whenever needed, any of their friends: Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.

                            For the back-end I also work with PHP (Symfony, Laravel, Wordpress, etc). But I also know how to use NodeJS whenever needed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I'm also a designer.<br>
                            I feel comfortable working with many Adobe products. Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom or Xd are some kind of industry
                            standards and I love working with them. I'm not limited to them, though: Gimp, Inkscape or Figma are also very valid applications that I've been working with.

                            User interfaces, brochures, books, branding... You name it! As I mentioned, creating pretty things is particularly important for me.
